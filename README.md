# Project 1 Generative Text

Yifan Hou, yihou@ucsd.edu


## Abstract

Science fiction story is always imaginative and futuristic, and  it contains many advanced science and technologies. Sometimes it even could inspire and influence current people. Due to these characteristics, science fiction writers not only need to master much acknoledge of science but also need to make their stories lierary. It is difficult to keep balance between these two. In this project, we are curious about if we could use machine to write science fiction story and the quality of that. We use RNN model to do this text generate task. The dataset we used was original created by Robin Sloan who in turn collected it largely from the Pulp Magazine Archive.
The training data is pretty large, so we will break it into smalle sizes.



## Model/Data

training model is RNN model
 training data we get it from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/jannesklaas/scifi-stories-text-corpus#internet_archive_scifi_v3.txt

## Code


Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
